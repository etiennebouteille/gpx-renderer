        <h2>About this website</h2>
        <p>Birdview converts gps tracking data to a rendered map of the environment around the path. 
            The goal is to output a nice image, ready to be kept as a memory or shared with friends. 
            As opposed to other similiar tools, Birview uses raytraced rendering instead of realtime 3D. 
            Raytraced rendering allows beautiful, physically accurate representation of light.</p>
        <p>This website is made by me, <a href="http://etiennebouteille.com">Etienne Bouteill√©</a>. I made the design, backend and frontend dev, 
            as well as all the shenanigans to automate the renders in Blender. 
            The gpx trace featured on the homepage is also mine. I use this website to view 
            my own outdoor adventure, and run it on my own server. Everyone is welcome to use 
            it but there is no guarantee it will be up tomorrow. Enjoy it while you can!</p>
        <p>This entire website is built on top and thanks to open source technologies and data. 
            Thank you Blender, Blender-osm, NodeJs, RaspberryPi, ArcGIS.
            All the source code for this website is available on github</p>
